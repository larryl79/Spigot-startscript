SpigotMC / BungeeCorf startscript

This is a script for start/stop/restart Bungeechord / SpigotMC

Put it into your BungeeCord / SpigotMC directory and edit servername.dat, insert your jar filename without extension.


Basically for SpigotMC I make a symlink to SpigotMC jar file, and enter the symlink name into servername.dat. So will be easy identify the servers when tey are running.
